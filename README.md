# AO3-Skins
a collection of ao3 skins made by yours truly <3

## How to use
1. go to https://archiveofourown.org/skins/new
2. make sure it says **site skin** under **type**. (in the future i may make work skins)
3. give it a name! preferrably something that **describes the skin** (ex. "kawaii pastel pink" for a cute pink skin)
4. copy and paste the content in the **css file** of the skin you want to use into the **css box**
5. **submit** the skin, scroll to the bottom, and click **use**

i will make a better tutorial one day...

## Terms
no specific terms of use (you can use/edit this to your heart's content, or turn the css into a theme for another site, etc...) however link back to this page if someone asks where the theme is from or if you publish a skin that uses one of these as a base!
